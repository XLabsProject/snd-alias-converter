# ![img format](SoundAliasConverter/cardicon_loadedfinger.png) Sound alias format converter

This small tool is made to convert sound aliases between the various Zonetool and Zonebuilder formats.
So far and with the tools we have, soundaliases come in two formats:
- Json: used by [zonebuilder](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw4x-client) (all versions) and [zonetool](https://github.com/ZoneTool/zonetool) (release 1.0.172 and downwards)
- Binary (.xss): used by [zonetool](https://github.com/ZoneTool/zonetool) (release 1.0.181 and upwards)

The goal of this tool is to make it easier to convert one format into the other, as for now none of the existing tools support both formats at a time.
